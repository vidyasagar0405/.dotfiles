# ChadWM (My riced version)

<img width="200" src="https://i.imgflip.com/5imrkq.jpg">

I've been using DWM for a while, so I thought why not used ChadWM cuz I'm a chad.

FYI, ChadWM is basically a DWM rice/modif. So I basically riced the rice :)

## Note

This project a modification of the real [ChadWM](https://github.com/siduck/chadwm). Since the upstream is on GitHub, I couldn't
fork it on GitLab.
